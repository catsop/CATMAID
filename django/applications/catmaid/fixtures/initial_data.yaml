      A simple list of all projects and their stacks. It is rendered in the
      browser with the help of JavaScript and it does not support any
      configuration options. The config field of a data view is therefore
      likely to read only {}.

      A simple adjustable list of all projects and their stacks. This view is
      rendered server side and supports the display of sample images. The
      following options are available: "filter_tags": [list of tags],
      "sample_images": [true|false], "sample_stack": ["first"|"last"],
      "sample_slice": [slice number|"first"|"center"|"last"],
      "sample_width": [pixel size] and "sample_height": [pixel size]. By
      default projects are sorted. Use "sort":false to turn this off. Thus,
      a valid sample configuration could look like: {"sample_images":true,
      "sample_stack":"last", "sample_slice":"center", "sample_width":100,
      "filter_tags":["TagA","TagB"]}

      A simple table of all projects and their stacks. This view is rendered
      server side and supports the display of sample images instead of stack
      names. The following options are available: "filter_tags": [list of tags],
      "sample_images": [true|false], "sample_slice":
      [slice number|"first"|"center"|"last"], "sample_width": [pixel size],
      "sample_height": [pixel size] and "sort": [true|false]. By default
      projects are sorted and displayed without images. A valid configuration
      could look like: {"sample_images":true, "sample_slice":"center",
      "sample_height":42, "filter_tags":["TagA","TagB"]}

      A table that allows to define tags for the columns and rows. This view is
      rendered server side and supports the display of sample images instead of
      stack names. The following options are available: "filter_tags": [list of
      tags], "col_tags": [list of tags], "row_tags": [list of tags],
      "sample_images": [true|false], "sample_slice":
      [slice number|"first"|"center"|"last"], "sample_width": [pixel size],
      "sample_height": [pixel size], "sort": [true|false]. By default projects
      are sorted and displayed without images. A valid configuration could look
      like: {"row_tags":["DAPI","Crb"], "col_tags":["Wing Disc","CNS"]}
